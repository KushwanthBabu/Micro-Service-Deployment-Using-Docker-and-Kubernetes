**Microservices Deployment using Docker & Kubernetes**

This project demonstrates deployment of a simple Node.js microservices architecture using Docker, Docker Compose, and Kubernetes (Minikube).

The system consists of three services:

user-service (Port 4000)

product-service (Port 5000)

api-gateway (Port 3000)

I containerized each service using Docker, orchestrated them locally with Docker Compose, and then deployed the user-service to a Kubernetes cluster using Minikube.

Through this project, I practiced:

Containerization with Docker

Multi-container orchestration

Kubernetes Deployments and Services

Replica scaling

NodePort exposure

Image management in Minikube

Debugging using kubectl

This project helped me understand real-world DevOps concepts like service discovery, internal DNS, replica management, and production-style deployment workflows.
